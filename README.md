# Scientific Calculator

A simple command-line scientific calculator written in C. This calculator can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Additionally, it offers a range of scientific functions, including exponentiation, square root, sine, cosine, tangent, logarithm, factorial, and modulus.

## Features
- Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division of two numbers
- Exponentiation and Square Root of a given number
- Trigonometric functions: Sine, Cosine, and Tangent (input in degrees)
- Logarithm (base 10) of a given number
- Factorial of a non-negative integer
- Modulus (remainder) of two numbers
- Clear Screen option to improve user experience

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt in the project directory.
3. Compile the `calculator.c` file using a C compiler (e.g., GCC):
   ```
   gcc calculator.c -o calculator
   ```
4. Run the executable:
   ```
   ./calculator
   ```
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to perform the desired calculations.
6. To exit the calculator, enter '0' when prompted for the choice.
